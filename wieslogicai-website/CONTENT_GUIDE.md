3. **Numbers-Focused** - Specific metrics, not vague promises
4. **Urgency** - FOMO, scarcity, time-sensitivity
5. **Authority** - We're experts, you're in good hands

### Grant Cardone Formula
```
PROBLEM (pain) → AGITATION (make it hurt) → SOLUTION (our AI) → PROOF (results) → CALL TO ACTION (now!)

## ✍️ Writing Rules

### Do:
✅ Use short sentences. Punch. Impact.
✅ Ask questions. Make readers nod.
✅ Use numbers. Specific > vague.
✅ Create urgency. Time is running out.
✅ Speak directly. "You" and "Your".

### Don't:
❌ Use jargon or corporate-speak
❌ Be vague or wishy-washy
❌ Bury the CTA
❌ Forget to create FOMO
❌ Sound like everyone else

---

**Remember:** Every word should either build trust, create urgency, or drive action.

**Go 10X or go home.**
